                <div class="felix-text">
                    <p>Felix was surrendered to us after his elderly owner died. It was immediately clear that he was
                        used to being King of the castle!<br>
                        As a hairless sphinx, he requires daily cleaning in the folds of his skin and his own heating so
                        he stays warm during the winter months.
                        One of our volunteers was even kind enough to knit him his own sweater!
                        Felix also requires special gentle cat food to prevent stomach irritation. He is happiest curled
                        up on a lap, and would make a wonderful companion for someone committed to this highly
                        sort-after breed!

                <div class="row">

                        <p class="felix-text">
                            Felix hasn't found his forever home yet, but with his winning personality, we are sure it
                            won't be long!<br>
                            As he is used to being an only-cat, he would best suit a household with no other animals. He
                            is good with children and strangers, in fact he loves the attention!
                            <br>Due to his health needs and his breed, he needs an owner who is willing to put the time
                            in to care for him properly. As he has no fur, he is hypoallergenic...great news for
                            would-be cat owners who are allergic to other breeds!
                            <br>Some cat owners buy exotic breeds like the hairless sphinx without knowing what it
                            entails. If you would like to know more about what it takes to care for a cat like Felix,
                            or if you have already fallen in love and would like to give him a forever home, please
                            contact us to discuss our adoption process.

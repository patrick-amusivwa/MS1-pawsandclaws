                    <p><b>Paws and Claws</b> was established in 1992 by Ron and Irene Adler. Life long animal lovers,
                        they dedicated their retirement from law to the rescue and rehabilitation of strays. What
                        started as
                        a project run by a couple out of a converted shed has grown into a charity, with its own custom
                        built facility and over
                        20 full and part-time staff members!
                        <br> We are committed to never turning our backs on an animal in need. Many come to us needing
                        vital medical attention or indepth
                        training to deal with behavioural issues before they can hope to rehomed. Thankfully, we have
                        highly trained volunteers who can meet
                        these needs and more!
                        <br>We are proud that over the years, we have rehomed over 5,000 animals, performed over 500
                        life-saving surgeries and delivered 35 litters of puppies and kittens!
                        If you would like to know more about what we do or what animals are currently available for
                        adoption, come visit us or send <span class="in-text-link"><a href="contact.html"

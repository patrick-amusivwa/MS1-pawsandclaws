                <div class="lassie-text">
                    <p>Lassie was surrendered to us by their previous owner. Lassie was very upset to have left their
                        old home,
                        but quickly bonded with our team. It was clear that this gorgeous dog had a wonderful
                        personality. When housed with other animals,
                        she was quick to make friends and even comfort them in their time of need.<br>
                        Lassie had a hard time adjusting to her new life. She required indepth one-to-one training to
                        house-train her and build her confidence.
                        She would hide under the table whenever someone new was around. It took a lot of time, treats
                        and cuddles to get her to the friendly, outgoing dog she is today.

                        <p class="lassie-text">Once Lassie realised we were here to help her, there was no stopping her!
                            She is tremendously gentle and a pleasure to be around.
                            She loves to play with her fluffy teddy bear and tennis balls.<br>
                            Lassie is still looking for her forever home, but one look into her soft brown eyes will
                            make anyone fall in love with her. Her behavioural issues means that
                            she is better suited to a quiet family home, preferrably without small children. She is
                            wonderful with other animals, including cats.<br>
                            Dogs who have had a bad start in life can sometimes get written off. However, with a bit of
                            patience and dedication, they can become the most wonderful of companions and a true
                            friend.<br>
                            If you think you can offer a dog like Lassie a loving, peaceful home, contact us now to
                            discuss the adoption process.

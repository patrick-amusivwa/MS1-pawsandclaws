                <div class="marley-text">
                    <p>You'd never think to look at him now, but Marley was found by two of our volunteers,
                        scavanging in bins near Neath railway station. <br> He was severely underweight, riddled with
                        mites and had a nasty scratch on his belly.
                        His beautiful white fur was so covered in dirt, we thought he was grey before he got his first
                        bath! When we took him in a year ago,
                        we weren't sure how this street-wise cat would adapt to being around humans.
                        We think he had been on the streets for around a year, possibly after being abandoned. <br> We
                        started very slowly, healing his wounds before trying him
                        in a home environment. We were all overjoyed when he transformed from a rough and ready
                        alley-cat, to a purring, contented gentleman practically overnight! It
                        felt like he was ready to become a pamper house-cat.</p>

                        <p class="marley-text">Marley is now comfortably rehomed with a lovely couple in Swansea, not
                            far from his old stomping ground! His new owners, Stephanie and Steven,
                            say he is the 'perfect gentleman, always immaculately presented and pride of place in the
                            sunniest spot on the windowsill'. At two years old,
                            Marley was the perfect choice for his new owners who 'didn't want the hyperactivity of a new
                            kitten'. He still enjoys playing with his mouse toy, and exploring the back-garden,
                            but he's also a wonderful companion, equally happy cuddling on the bed.<br>
                            Older cats like Marley sometimes get overlooked at shelters. It can be hard to convince
                            people that an older cat has as much joy and love to give as
                            a kitten. Marley is proof that you can teach an old cat new tricks!<br> If you would like to
                            give a cat like Marley a second chance, contact us now to discuss the adoption process.
